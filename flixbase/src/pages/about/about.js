          Flixbase is a Portfolio Project for ALX school, a place where we
          have honed our skills as aspiring software engineers. This project has
          been an integral part of our learning journey, allowing us to apply
          the knowledge and techniques we've gained throughout our coursework.
          We are grateful to ALX for providing us with the

          <div className="posterImage__title">Inspiration_____</div>
          Flixbase is more than just a project for usâ€”it's a passion project
          born out of our deep love for movies and the desire to create a
          platform that truly celebrates the magic of cinema. Our journey began
          as a group of avid movie enthusiasts, driven by the idea of building a
          comprehensive movie database service that would bring together film
          lovers from all walks of life. We wanted to create a place where
          people could immerse themselves in the captivating world of movies,
          discover new favorites, and connect with like-minded individuals who
          share the same passion.
