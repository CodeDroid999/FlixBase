### FlixBase

MVP Specification for FlixBase:	
Components:
FlixBase is a web application that provides a platform for users to search and access a vast library of movies and TV shows. The application architecture consists of various components that work together to deliver a seamless user experience. Here is a breakdown of each component and its role within the FlixBase system:
 

1. DNS (Domain Name System):
- Responsible for translating domain names (e.g., FlixBase.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 85.129.83.120) to route user requests to the appropriate server.
- Provides a key/value lookup for domain names and IP addresses.

2. Load Balancer:
- Distributes incoming user requests across multiple web servers to ensure efficient resource utilization and fault tolerance.
- Routes requests to one of several web servers that run the FlixBase application.
- Prevents overloading any single server and provides scalability.

3. Web Application Servers:
- Execute the core business logic of the FlixBase application.
- Handle user requests and generate HTML responses.
- Communicate with backend infrastructure such as databases, caching services, job queues, search services, and other microservices.
- Multiple web servers are typically used in conjunction with a load balancer.

4. Database Servers:
- Store and manage the data used by FlixBase, such as movie and TV show information.
- Provide ways to define data structures, insert new data, query existing data, and perform computations.
- Can include both SQL and NoSQL databases, depending on the specific requirements of the application.

5. Caching Service:
- Stores frequently accessed data to improve performance and reduce the load on databases.
- Utilizes a key/value data store for fast retrieval of information.
- Caches results from expensive computations, database queries, external service calls, and more.
- Popular caching server technologies include Redis and Memcache.

6. Job Queue & Servers:
- Handles asynchronous tasks that are not directly associated with responding to user requests.
- Consists of a job queue that stores pending tasks and job servers (workers) that process those tasks.
- Jobs can include encoding videos, processing CSV files, aggregating statistics, sending emails, and more.
- Enables efficient and scalable background processing of tasks.

7. Full-text Search Service:
- Powers the search functionality within FlixBase.
- Uses an inverted index to quickly retrieve relevant documents based on user queries.
- Often implemented using dedicated search services like Elasticsearch, Sphinx, or Apache Solr.

8. Services:
- Separate applications within the FlixBase ecosystem that are not exposed externally.
- Used internally by the main application and other services.
- Examples include account service, content service, payment service, and HTML to PDF service.

9. Data:
- Involves collecting, storing, and analyzing data generated by the FlixBase application.
- Utilizes a data pipeline to ingest, transform, and store data for analysis.
- Raw data is sent to a data firehose for processing, then saved to cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3).
- Transformed data is loaded into a data warehouse (e.g., AWS Redshift) for further analysis.

10. Cloud Storage:
- Provides scalable and accessible storage for various types of data.
- Enables interaction with stored data via a RESTful API over the Internet.
- Commonly used cloud storage platforms include Amazon S3.

11. CDN (Content Delivery Network):
- Accelerates the delivery of static assets (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) to users.
- Distributes content across edge servers located worldwide.
- Allows users to download assets from nearby edge servers, reducing latency and improving performance.

User Flow:
•	User searches on Google for "Comedy Movie" movie on FlixBase.
•	The first result is from FlixBase, the leading movie database site.
•	The user clicks the result, which redirects their browser to the movie details page.
•	The user's browser sends a request to a DNS server to lookup how to contact FlixBase.
•	The request hits the load balancer, which randomly selects one of the web servers running the site.
•	The web server receives the request and looks up information about the movie from the caching service.
•	The web server fetches the remaining data about the movie from the database.
•	The web server identifies that the genre information for the movie has not been computed yet.
•	The web server sends a "genre computation" job to the job queue for asynchronous processing.
•	Job servers process the "genre computation" job, updating the database with the results.
•	The web server sends a request to the full-text search service to find similar movies using the movie's title.
•	The web server retrieves the user's account information from the account service since they are logged into FlixBase.
•	The web server fires off a page view event to the data firehose for recording in the cloud storage system.
•	The page view event will eventually be loaded into the data warehouse for analysis by the business analysts.
•	The server renders the view as HTML and sends it back to the user's browser, passing through the load balancer.
•	The page contains JavaScript and CSS assets that are loaded into the cloud storage system connected to the CDN.
•	The user's browser contacts the CDN to retrieve the JavaScript and CSS assets.
•	The browser visibly renders the page, and the user can see the movie details and related content.

This user flow describes the sequence of actions that occur when a user searches for a movie on FlixBase and views the movie details page. It highlights the interactions between the user's browser, DNS server, load balancer, web servers, caching service, job queue, full-text search service, account service, data firehose, cloud storage system, CDN, and data warehouse.
